The `this` keyword in JavaScript is a unique identifier in JavaScript whose value is determined at runtime and can vary depending where you are using it. As a result, the behavior of the `this` keyword seems confusing to many people, especially to those who are new to the language or have limited experience with its nuances.

<Callout>
  Are you are coming from a different programming languages e.g. C++, Java, C#,
  PHP etc, whree the `this` keyword represents the current instance of the
  class? I've a bad news for you. JavaScript's `this` keyword very differently.
</Callout>

This article aims to explore the value of the `this` keyword in different contexts. Let's dive in and unveil the mysteries of the `this` keyword!

## Global context

When we use the `this` keyword in the global scope (i.e. outside any function), it's value refers to the _global object_. Now what is the global object in JavaScript?

### Global object

The global object is the top-level object in the scope chain and acts as a container for all global variables (defined with the `var` keyword), functions, and objects.

In the browser environment, the global object is the `window` object. It provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser environment. Global functions like `console.log`, `parseInt()`, `setTimeout()` or global objects like `Date` are actually properties of the `window` object.

```js
console.log(this === window); // true
console.log(console === window.console); // true
console.log(setTimeout === window.setTimeout); // true
console.log(document === window.document); // true
```

In Node.js environment, the global object is `global` object. It sounds strange as sentence, but the name of the object is `global`. It's similar to how the `window` object is used in browsers but designed for server-side JavaScript execution.

```js
console.log(this === global); // true
console.log(this === global.setTimeout); // true
```

## Function context

When a function is called, the value of the `this` keyword refers to the global object in non-strict mode, or `undefined` in strict mode.

```jsx
function sayHello() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
}

sayHello(); // Hello, my name is undefined
```

<Callout>
  When `sayHello()` is called in strict mode, this inside the function becomes
  `undefined` instead of referring to the global object. It will throw an error
  "Cannot read property 'name' of undefined".
</Callout>

## Explicit function binding

Sometimes we need to explicitly bind the `this` keyword to a specific object to ensure that the function operates with the correct `this` value, regardless of how it is invoked.

We have three methods to accomplish this: `call`, `apply`, and `bind`, which we may call on any function. When a function is invoked with the `call`, `apply`, or `bind`, the `this` keyword will refer to what we pass in as the first parameter.

### Function.prototype.call()

In the following example, we're explicitly binding the `this` keyword to the `person` object. It takes the following input parameters:

- `thisArg`: The value to be passed as the this context within the function.
- `arg1`, `arg2`, ...: Optional arguments to be passed to the function individually.

```jsx
const person = { firstName: "Naimul" };
function sayHello(greet) {
  console.log(`${greet}, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
}
sayHello(); // Hi, my name is undefined
sayHello.call(person, "Hi"); // Hi, my name is Naimul
```

In this example, the `sayHello` function is called with the `call` method, which binds the `this` to the person object, so the output is "Hi, my name is Naimul".

### Function.prototype.apply()

The `apply` method is another method that allows us to call a function and explicitly set the `this` value. However, unlike `call`, `apply` takes arguments as an array or an array-like object. It takes the following input parameters:

- `thisArg`: The value to be passed as the this context within the function.
- `[arg1, arg2, ...]`: An array containing the arguments to be passed to the function.

```js
const person = { firstName: "Naimul" };
function sayHello(greet) {
  console.log(`${greet}, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
}
sayHello.apply(person, ["Hi"]); // Hi, my name is Naimul
```

### Function.prototype.bind()

Unlike `call` and `apply`, `bind` does not execute the function immediately but instead returns a new function where the `this` context is fixed to a specified object.

```js
const person = { firstName: "Naimul" };
function sayHello(greet) {
  console.log(`${greet}, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
}
const sayHelloWithPerson = sayHello.bind(person, "Hola");
sayHelloWithPerson();
```

<Callout>
  Did you notice anything strange? The `greet` parameter is pre-filled with
  "Hello".
</Callout>

## Object method binding

When a method is called on an object in JavaScript, the `this` keyword inside that method refers to the object itself. This behavior is known as _method binding_ and it's a fundamental aspect of how object-oriented programming works in JavaScript.

### Example

Let's look at the following example

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "Naimul",
  greet: function () {
    // this refers to the `person` object
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
  },
};
person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Naimul"
```

What happens when we use arrow functions instead of regular functions? Let's find out!

```js
const person = {
  firstName: "Naimul",
  greet: () => {
    // this refers to the `person` object
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
  },
};
person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is undefined"
```

Arrow functions behave differently than regular functions. The arrow function `printName` captures the `this` value from the surrounding scope, which, in this case, is the global scope (the outermost scope).

<Callout>
  It's generally recommended to use regular function expressions or function
  statements. It's because you need to access the object's properties or other
  methods.
</Callout>

### Nested function

Let's moved the `console.log` in a nested function and call the function within the method. Trust me! We'll find out something interesting.

```jsx
const person = {
  firstName: "Naimul",
  greet: function () {
    function showGreetingMessage() {
      // `this` refers to the `global` object
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.fullName}`);
    }
    showGreetingMessage();
  },
};

person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is undefined"
```

The value of `this` in the `showGreetingMessage()` function is the `global` object, because it is being invoked as a standalone function and not as a method of any object. It does not inherit the `this` value of the outer schop. To fix this issue, we can take several approach

- Storing the `this` variable in a `self` variable, and use `self` inside the function
- Calling the `showGreetingMessage` function with `call`, `bind` or `apply`
- Using arrow functions

To fix this, we'll convert our regular functions into arrow functions.

```jsx
const anotherPerson = {
  fullName: "John Doe",
  greet: function () {
    const showGreetingMessage = () => {
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.fullName}`);
    };
    showGreetingMessage();
  },
};
anotherPerson.greet();
```

By changing these regular functions to arrow functions, the `this` value is no longer redefined within the function, and instead, it inherits the `this` value from the surrounding myFriend object. This allows the arrow functions to access the correct `this` value, which is the myFriend object, and fix the issue with `this` not pointing to the right object.

The topic of arrow functions is broad and can require its own in-depth exploration. In a future article, we can dive deeper into advanced concepts related to arrow functions and best practices for their usage in different scenarios.

## Constructor functions

When a function is called as a constructor with the `new` keyword, `this` is bound to the newly created object. For example:

```jsx
// `this` refers to the newly created object which is returned by the new Person() call
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
const me = new Person("Naimul", 26);
console.log(me); // Person { name: 'Naimul', age: 26 }
```

In conclusion, I hope this article has shed some light on the `this` keyword and now you understand it clearly in various contexts.
