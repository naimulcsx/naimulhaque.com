A prime number is a integer greater than $1$ and has no positive divisors other than $1$ and itself. $1$ is neither prime nor composite. The set of positive integers can be divided into three classes, primes, composites and a unit ($1$). For example, $5$ is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, $1 \times 5$ or $5 \times 1$, involve $5$ itself.

## Primilarity test

Now that we understand prime numbers, how can we determine if a number is prime or not? There are two types of primilarity test, deterministic and probabilistic.

A Deterministic algorithm can determine whether a number is prime or not with absolute certainty. But the probabilistic algorithms tell us where a number is probable prime or composite. Probabilistic primilarity tests can&apos;t determine a prime with absolute certainty, but it works most of the time. A composite number which passes through a probabilistic test is called a psuedo prime.

In this article, we&apos;ll see the basic trial division approach and how we can improve that. There are also some probabilistic primilarity test, like Fermat primilarity test, Millar Rabin primality test etc. I&apos;ll post an article about these probabilistic algorithms in a week or two.

## Trial division

One bruteforce way to determine the primilarity of a number n is to go through each number $a_i$ in the range $a = [2, n - 1]$ and check whether n is divisible by $a_i$. If any number divides n in the range $[2, n - 1]$, then we can coclude that the number n is not a prime number. But if we don&apos;t find a single divisor of $n$ in the range $[2, n - 1]$, that means n is a prime.

```cpp
bool is_prime = true;
for (int i = 2; i < n; ++i) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
        is_prime = false;
        break;
    }
}
if ( is_prime ) cout << n << " is a prime number." << endl;
else cout << n << " is a composite number." << endl;
```

However, the time complexity for this naive algorithm is $O(n)$, hence it&apos;s very much slow when we are working with large primes and product of large primes. However we can improve that significantly. In the previous method, we run a check in the range $[2, n - 1]$, which was unnecessary. It is sufficient to check in the range $[2, \sqrt{n}]$ to determine if n is prime or not? But Why? This is because every composite number has a divisor less than or equal to the square root of itself.

Suppose that n is a composite. Then we can write n=a \times b for integers a and b which are both greater than $1$. If both $a>\sqrt{n}$ and $b>\sqrt{n}$ then we would have $ab> \sqrt{n} \times \sqrt{n}$ thus $ab > n$, which is a contradiction. Hence either $a \leq \sqrt{n}$ or $b \leq \sqrt{n}$, so if you check as far as $\sqrt{n}$ and don&apos;t find a divisor of $n$ greater than $1$, then $n$ must be a prime. Thus, we can conclude that a composite number has a divisor less than or equal to the square root of itself.

What about the divisors greater that $\sqrt{n}$? There may be many divisors greater than $\sqrt{n}$ but a composite number has at most one prime divisor greater than it&apos;s square root. Assume there is such a divisor and denote it by $p$. Then $n = m \times p$ with $p > \sqrt{n}$. Therefore $m < \sqrt{n}$ as $m = n / p$. Any other prime divisor of $n$ must be a divisor of $m$, which must be less than $\sqrt{n}$ as $m$ is less than $\sqrt{n}$.

```cpp
bool is_prime = true;
for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; ++i) {
    if (n % i == 0) {
        is_prime = false;
        break;
    }
}
if (is_prime) cout << n << " is a prime number" << endl;
else cout << n << " is a composite number" << endl;
```
