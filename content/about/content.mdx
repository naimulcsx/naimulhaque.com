## Hey there, I’m Naimul.&#x20;

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had an *insatiable curiosity* about how things work. Whether it’s something in my domain or not, I’ve always loved *digging deep* to understand the mechanics of the world around me. It’s that same *curiosity* that has shaped my journey so far.

I began my academic life studying *Chemical Engineering*, but something was missing—it just didn’t give me that *dopamine rush* I was searching for. Then I switched to *Computer Science*. From my very first semester, I found myself diving headfirst into *competitive programming* and *problem-solving*, honing my skills. It was like stepping into a new universe where every line of code and every solved problem brought me *joy*.&#x20;

Over the years, my passion for writing code has grown into a *career*. Whether it’s building *full-stack web applications*, leading teams, or integrating *cutting-edge AI* into real-world solutions, I’ve been fortunate to work on projects that have stretched my abilities and broadened my horizons. I’ve discovered that problem-solving isn’t just about the solution—it’s about the journey, the learning, and the innovation that come with it. I’ve also discovered a deep love for teaching and mentorship, helping students and peers unlock their potential.

Outside of work, I still keep that curious spark alive—exploring *new technologies*, tackling tough *coding challenges*. To me, every step is an opportunity to grow, learn, and contribute.

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share stories, insights, and a glimpse into my journey. Let’s connect, learn, and build something incredible together.
