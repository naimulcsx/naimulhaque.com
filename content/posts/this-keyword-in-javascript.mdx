The `this` keyword is a unique identifier in JavaScript. The value of `this` is determined at runtime and can vary depending where you are using it. As a result, the behavior of the `this` keyword seems confusing to many people, especially to those who are new to the language or have limited experience with its nuances.

> _In other languages, e.g. C++, Java, C# etc, the_ `this` keyword represents the current instance of a class, But JavaScript's `this` keyword is a bit different in nature. So it's better not to compare with how it works in other languages.

This article aims to explore the value of the `this` keyword in different contexts. Let's dive in and unveil the mysteries of the `this` keyword!

## this in global scope

### Global object

When we use the `this` keyword in the global scope (i.e. outside any function), it's value refers to the `global` _object_.

The `global` object is the top-level object in the scope chain and acts as a container for all global variables (defined with the `var` keyword), functions, and objects.

In the browser environment, the global object is the `window` object. It provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser environment.

```js
console.log(this); // the window object
console.log(window); // same as previous statement
```

Global functions like `console.log`, `parseInt`, `setTimeout` or global objects like `document`, `Date` etc. are properties of the `window` object.

```ts
console.log(console === window.console); // true
console.log(setTimeout === window.setTimeout); // true
console.log(document === window.document); // true
```

In Node.js environment, the global object is `global` object. It sounds strange as a sentence, but the identifier of the object itself is `global`. It's similar to how the `window` object is used in browsers but designed for server-side JavaScript execution.

```ts
console.log(this === global); // true
console.log(this === global.setTimeout); // true
```

# this inside Functions

When a function is called, the value of the `this` keyword refers to the `global` object in non-strict mode, or `undefined` in strict mode.

```ts
// using the var keyword, so that the variable
// firstName gets attached with the global object
var firstName = "Naimul";

function sayHello() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
}

sayHello(); // Hello, my name is Naimul
```

> _The same piece of code when run in_ `strict mode`, It will throw an error “Cannot read property ‘name’ of undefined”. It’s because the value of `this` inside the function becomes `undefined` instead of referring to the `global` object.

## Explicit function binding

Sometimes we need to explicitly bind the `this` keyword to a specific object to ensure that the function operates with the correct `this` value, regardless of how it is invoked.

We have three methods in JavaScript to accomplish this: `call`, `apply`, and `bind`, which we may call on any function. When a function is invoked with the `call`, `apply`, or `bind`, the `this` keyword will refer to what we pass in as the first parameter.

### Function.prototype.call()

In the following example, we’re explicitly binding the `this` keyword to the `person` object. It takes the following input parameters:

- `thisArg`: The value to be passed as the this context within the function.
- `arg1`, `arg2`, ...: Optional arguments to be passed to the function individually.

```ts
const person = {
  firstName: "Naimul"
};

function sayHello(greet) {
  console.log(this === person); // true
  console.log(`${greet}, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
}

sayHello(); // Hi, my name is undefined
sayHello.call(person, "Hi"); // Hi, my name is Naimul
```

In this example, the `sayHello` function is called with the `call` method, which binds the `this` to the `person` object, so the output is "Hi, my name is Naimul".

### Function.prototype.apply()

The `apply` method is another method that allows us to call a function and explicitly set the `this` value. However, unlike `call`, `apply` takes arguments as an array or an array-like object. It takes the following input parameters:

- `thisArg`: The value to be passed as the this context within the function.
- `[arg1, arg2, ...]`: An array containing the arguments to be passed to the function.

```ts
const person = {
  firstName: "Naimul"
};

function sayHello(greet) {
  console.log(`${greet}, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
}

sayHello.apply(person, ["Hi"]); // Hi, my name is Naimul
```

### Function.prototype.bind()

Unlike `call` and `apply`, `bind` does not execute the function immediately but instead returns a new function where the `this` context is fixed to a specified object.

```ts
const person = {
  firstName: "Naimul"
};

function sayHello(greet) {
  console.log(`${greet}, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
}

const sayHelloWithPerson = sayHello.bind(person, "Hola");
sayHelloWithPerson();
```

> _Note that the_ `greet` parameter is pre-filled with "Hello". Even if we invoke it with a different greet value, `sayHelloWithPerson("Hello")` , it won’t use the new value.

## this inside methods

When a method is called on an object in JavaScript, the `this` keyword inside that method refers to the object itself. This behavior is known as _method binding_ and it's a fundamental aspect of how objects works in JavaScript. Let's look at the following example

```ts
const person = {
  firstName: "Naimul",
  greet: function () {
    // `this` refers to the object itself - the `person` object
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
  }
};

person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Naimul"
```

What happens when we use arrow functions instead of regular functions? Let’s find out!

```ts
const person = {
  firstName: "Naimul",
  greet: () => {
    // `this` refers to the global object
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
  }
};
person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is undefined"
```

Arrow functions behave differently than regular functions. The arrow function `printName` captures the `this` value from the surrounding scope, which, in this case, is the global scope (the outermost scope).

> _It’s generally recommended to use regular function expressions or function statements. It’s because you need to access the object’s properties or other methods._

## Nested function

What happens if we have nested functions within a method? Let’s move the `console.log` in a nested function and call the function within the method. Trust me! We'll find out something very interesting.

```ts
const person = {
  firstName: "Naimul",
  greet: function () {
    function showGreetingMessage() {
      // `this` refers to the `global` object
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.fullName}`);
    }
    showGreetingMessage();
  }
};

person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is undefined"
```

The value of `this` in the `showGreetingMessage()` function is the `global` object, because it is being invoked as a standalone function and not as a method of any object. It does not inherit the `this` value of the outer scope. To fix this issue, we can take several approach

- Storing the `this` variable in a `self` variable, and use `self` inside the function
- Calling the `showGreetingMessage` function with `call`, `bind` or `apply`
- Switching to arrow functions

To fix this, we’ll convert our regular functions into arrow functions.

```ts
const anotherPerson = {
  fullName: "John Doe",
  greet: function () {
    const showGreetingMessage = () => {
      console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.fullName}`);
    };
    showGreetingMessage();
  }
};
anotherPerson.greet();
```

By switching from regular functions to arrow functions, the `this` value is no longer redefined within the function, and instead, it inherits the `this` value from the surrounding myFriend object. This allows the arrow functions to access the correct `this` value, which is the myFriend object, and fix the issue with `this` not pointing to the right object.

The topic of arrow functions is broad and can require its own in-depth exploration. In a future article, we can dive deeper into advanced concepts related to arrow functions and best practices for their usage in different scenarios.

## Constructor functions

When a function is called as a constructor with the `new` keyword, `this` is bound to the newly created object. For example:

```ts
// `this` refers to the newly created object
// which is returned by the new Person() call
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const me = new Person("Naimul", 26);

console.log(me); // Person { name: 'Naimul', age: 26 }
```

# this inside callback functions

Callback functions are functions that you pass to another function as an argument, so that they can be executed after some async operation (most of the time, but not always). Let’s try to assume what will be the output of the following function

```ts
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(this); // Window {...}
  }, 1000);
}
const me = new Person("Naimul", 26);
```

To fix this you can either explicitly bind the function to the proper `this` value or you can use arrow functions.

```ts
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(this); // Person { name: 'Naimul', age: 26 }
  }, 1000);
}
const me = new Person("Naimul", 26);
```

In conclusion, I hope this article has shed some light on the `this` keyword and now you understand it clearly in various contexts.
